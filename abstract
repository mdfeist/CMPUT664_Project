% Motive/Problem
Analysing repositories - lack of good tools? GitHub metrics are misleading or not
useful.
% Why is it important
It can be difficult to see how a large project evolves.
We want to see who is doing what (lines changed is misleading; number of
commits are MASSIVELY misleading).
% -- $/lines, $/commit?
% What we make to solve it
We present a novel tool for visualizing Git Java projects.
% What does it do?
It visualizes changes in type usage over time per project per user, totals usage,
gets statistics using the differences between abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
Types are Methods or declarations; Add or delete.
The commit AST diffs is a reentrant algorithm that can be incrementally
calulcated, as new commits are made.
