  abstract = {This guest post is written by Alexander Kuznetsov, co-founder of StiltSoft. Alexander has seven years of experience as a software developer, including five years in developing add-ons for Atlassian platforms. He’s also the runner-up of 2012 Codegeist, Atlassian’s add-on development competition, for the add-on he built called, “Awesome Graphs for Stash.” We at StiltSoft, Atlassian verified vendor and expert, create add-ons for various Atlassian applications. Our team is always eager to provide developers with the handy tools they need so they can focus more on the important stuff, deliver on their work commitments with fewer efforts and enjoy the process at the same time. One of our products is Awesome Graphs for Stash. It provides graphs and charts to visualize the contribution statistics in Git repositories, evaluate a team’s performance and get useful data for planning and analysis. We have watched Bitbucket evolve at a rapid pace and couldn’t wait for the opportunity to make Awesome Graphs available in the cloud. We were very excited when he heard about Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket. The Atlassian Connect framework made it possible to build the add-on and make Awesome Graphs available for 3 million developers on Bitbucket. Awesome Graphs for Bitbucket Our goal currently is to make the graphs and charts of Awesome Graphs for Stash available in Bitbucket so that Bitbucket developers can visualize the statistics of their repositories, keep track of what the contributors have done, get analytical data for running retrospectives and plan their future work while making informed decisions. It is always very inspiring to watch your projects evolve by checking graphs from time to time. You can track your progress, see the work that has been done and feel accomplished. We released the first version of Awesome Graphs for Bitbucket in June with Commits and Punchcard. That’s only the beginning and more graphs are coming in the next couple of months. Why should you use Awesome Graphs? The Commits~tab shows the number of commits made over the last year grouped by week on a given repository. The interactive scatter chart below the bar chart displays detailed daily commits for the week selected on the bar chart. This allows you to get a summarized history of each repository and understand when most of the work was done. The Punchcard~tab helps you figure out which hours of the week have been the most productive for your team by showing commit frequency on each day of the week and time starting from the first commit in the repository. This helps you~plan your day’s activities so that you are not distracted and completely focused during the most productive hours. Most importantly, you can use the insights to improve the performance and efficiency of your team. Wanna see it in action? You can try Awesome Graphs for Bitbucket by installing the add-on from the Find new add-ons section of Bitbucket. You can start using it as soon as the installation is completed. Navigate to the Graphs section on the left-hand sidebar to view commits and punchcard graphs of the current repository. You can also share your feature requests ~by voting and commenting in Awesome Graphs for Bitbucket forum. If you run into any issues while using Awesome Graphs for Bitbucket, please, contact us.},

However, this information is becoming of major interest, especially ---but not only--- because of the growth in the number of companies for which FOSS has become relevant for their business strategy. In this paper we present a novel approach to estimate effort by considering data from source code management repositories. We apply our model to the OpenStack project, a FOSS project with more than 1,000 authors, in which several tens of companies cooperate. Based on data from its repositories and together with the input from a survey answered by more than 100 developers, we show that the model offers a simple, but sound way of obtaining software development estimations with bounded margins of error.},

  abstract = {Software systems become progressively more complex and difficult to maintain. To facilitate maintenance tasks, project managers and developers often turn to the evolution history of the system to recover various kinds of useful information, such as anomalous phenomena and lost design decisions. An informative visualization of the evolution history can help cope with this complexity by highlighting conspicuous evolution events using strong visual cues. We present a scalable visualization technique called evolution spectrographs (ESG). An evolution spectrograph portrays the evolution of a spectrum of components based on a particular property measurement. We describe several special-purpose spectrographs and discuss their use in understanding and supporting software evolution through the case studies of three large software systems (OpenSSH, KOffice and FreeBSD).},

Researchers have observed that software systems also exhibit characteristics of punctuation (sudden and discontinuous change) during their evolution. We analyze punctuated evolution from the perspective of structural change. We developed a color-coded visualization technique called the Evolution Spectrograph (ESG). ESG can be applied to highlight conspicuous changes across a historical sequence of software releases. We describe evolution spectrographs and present the empirical results from our studies of three open source software systems: OpenSSH, PostgreSQL, and Linux. We show that punctuated change occurred in the evolution of these three systems, and we validate our empirical results by examining related software documents such as change logs and release notes.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICISA.2013.6579457},
  abstract = {Code repositories of the version control systems have been used as important raw material in lots of developer behavior studies. In such research, commits are usually considered as a unit of development phases, even though they contain limited information over development process. Unlike former source code management systems, Git provides branching, which are the unit of concurrent and independent development activities in a whole project. Branches have significant advantages over commits from the viewpoint of the developer behavior researchers. By exploiting the characteristics of branching, we propose a Git branch analysis tool. The proposed tool automatically extracts branching data from Git repositories and performs statistical and graphical analysis on them. Through a few case studies using a number of popular OSS project repositories, we showed that the proposed branch-oriented analyzer is able to perform more insightful analysis than the existing commit-based analyzers.},
