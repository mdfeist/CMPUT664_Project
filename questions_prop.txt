What do you plan to do?

We plan to come up with an empirical way of measuring a program usage of language features in Java.

What do you plan to answer?

We plan to see what features of a language programmers use, both ratio and quantity. The end goal is to determine the depth of the programmers knowledge and abilities.

What data will you use?

We first use Boa to find a set of suitable repositories (Java) and then download the repositories from GitHub. The information we need are the commits and ASTs.

What data will you have to collect?

We download will have to download the suitable repositories from GitHub.

What do you expect the result to be?

We expect to see a large amount of developers only using a small subset of the language.
